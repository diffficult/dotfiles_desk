With cameras.

You can do pretty well on some smartphone cameras too though. Some let you adjust ISO and exposure. Take multiple shots and stack them in Photoshop to remove the noise and bracket a HDR by taking multiple shots with different exposures using exposure compensation. Only hard thing is to keep the smartphone somewhat steady during all of that.

Also, GTA V is fucking fun.
